	<p>Born in Massachusetts, I am currently studying Political Science and Computer Science at Tufts University.  I am especially interested in American politics, as well as the various applications of computer science and programing skills to creating softeware tools for musicians.  Outside of academics, I play jazz and acoustic guitar and bluegrass mandolin and spend much of my free time listening to or playing music. I am also very interested in photography, especially photographing concerts and events.</p>
