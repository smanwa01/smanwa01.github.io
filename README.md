This project is a website that contains three pages/files: 
1.) index.html - my hompage. Includes links to my resume and bio, as well as an image of me and an introduction to my website.
2.) resume.html - my resume. Includes information about my past work experience, coursework, and other interests.
3.) bio.html - my bio. A brief introductory paragraph about me.

It also contains two .css files:
1.) main_stylesheet.css - Used for styling on index.html homepage.
2.) resume_stylesheet.css - Used for both resume.html and bio.html pages (I was unsure how renaming the file might affect pushing to github). 

I beleive I correctly implemented all aspects of this assignment. I was a little unsure about the correct way to create the bio and resume pages. I created the files in my master github repo and then linked them to my index.html page, which seems to have worked although I'm not sure it is the prefered method. 

I did not collaborate with any classmates on this assignment. I recieved some basic git/github help from a TA. 

I spent approximately _____ hours on this assignment.
